# Case Study 1 How does a bike share navigate speedy success
## 1.Introduction
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to understand the distinct usage patterns of its annual members versus casual riders. The insights gleaned from this analysis are crucial for developing an effective marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, a key objective for the company's future growth and profitability. 

## 2. Scenario
Working as a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing team, the primary goal is to boost annual memberships, which the marketing director sees as vital for the company's future. The team needs to investigate the differences in bike usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. This understanding will be used to create a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual users into annual members. 

## 3. Data analysis

### 1. Ask
Creating a marketing program to convert casual riders into members.

The future marketing program will be guided by three key questions:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

### 2. Prepare
Data source: Cyclistic's historical trip data, specifically the Divvy 2019 Q1 and Divvy 2020 Q1 datasets.
